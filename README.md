Programming References for RPI Microprocessor Systems using the STM32F769I-Discovery kit.

This repository contains all of the programming documentation for the course (excluding the lab documents themselves, which are in each lab's respective folder).

"Mastering STM32" can be purchased from here: https://leanpub.com/mastering-stm32. It is definitely one of the more important resources and is well worth the price.
