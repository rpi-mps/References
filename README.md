RPI Microprocessor Systems Repository for STM32F769I-Discovery Kit: References

This repository contains all the documentation for the course (excluding the labs themselves, which are in each lab's respective folder).

One additional reference should be purchased from here:

It's definitely one of the more important resources, and well worth the price.
